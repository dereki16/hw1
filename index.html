                Hello! <br/>
                <p>And welcome to the exciting world of Computer Science.</p>
                
                <p>Computer Science can be broken down into a multitude of different concentrations and fields.
                My website will cover a number of these fields and some relevant news.</p>
                
                <h2> Artificial Intelligence </h2>
                
                <figure>
                    <img src ="img/AI.png" alt = "Picture of AI" width=600px height=500px/>
                </figure>
                
                <p>Artificial Intelligence <strong>(AI)</strong> is an area of CS with the goal to make machine
                behave like humans, but perform at a higher capacity.</p>
                
                <p>AI has a lot of practical uses that can be explored, one such use has led to the development 
                of software able to recognize and track the faces of individual chimpanzees in the wild.
                This will help researchers and wildlife conservationists to cut back on the amount of time 
                and resources spent analyzing video footage.</p>
                
                <p>'For species like chimpanzees, which have complex social lives and live for many years, getting snapshots of their behaviour from short-term field research can only tell us so much,' says Dan Schofield, researcher and DPhil student at Oxford University's Primate Models Lab, School of Anthropology. 'By harnessing the power of machine learning to unlock large video archives, it makes it feasible to measure behaviour over the long term, for example observing how the social interactions of a group change over several generations.'</p>
                
                <p>This kind of technology has the potential for many uses such as monitoring species for conservation.
                While efforts are currently being focused on chimpanzees, there is no reason this tech could not be used 
                for other species. There's an evergrowing biodiversity crisis and plenty of ecosystems are under threat, 
                'the ability to closely monitor different species and populations using automated systems will be crucial
                for conservation efforts, as well as animal behaviour research' adds Schofield. 'Interdisciplinary 
                collaborations like this have huge potential to make an impact, by finding novel solutions for old problems,
                and asking biological questions which were previously not feasible on a large scale.'</p>
