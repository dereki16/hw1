            <p>According to IBM Research: "Software Development <strong>(SD)</strong> refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software."</p>
           
            <p><strong>Software engineers</strong> use engineering principles in order to build software
            and systems to solve problems. As opposed to simply solving for a specific instance or client, 
            they use modeling language and other tools to come to solutions that can be applied to problems 
            on a grander, more general scale.</p>
           
            <p><strong>Software developers</strong> have more liberty and can be closely involved with specific
            project areas such as coding. They drive the overall software development cycle. That includes working 
            alongside teams to develop features, manage the process, and conduct software testing and maintenance.</p>
