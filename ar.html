            <p>Augmented Reality <strong>(AR)</strong> technologies help blur the line between
            our world and a virtual one. It is the inclusion of interactive digital elements into 
            our real-world environments.</p>
            
            <p>A couple of years ago there was a storm of people coming out of their homes and interacting
            with the world like never before, thanks to Pokemon Go! This was an app that is capable of projecting
            those pocket monsters right in front of whoever has hold of the app. Pokemon Go! took the world 
            by storm and while it was a culmination of things like nostalgia, exercise, etc., the fact that 
            the creatures could be seen like that was huge.</p>
